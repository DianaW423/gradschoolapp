        <div class="section-content">
            <h1>Why it matters</h1>
            <p>Design is a strategic methodology that helps create pathways for others' experiences, helping to pinpoint where specifically issues are arising and then going back to refine. It is persistent. If we do not get out in the field and stray away from books, we will never truly know or experience what matters and who's impacted.  I'm eager to use low-fidelity prototypes, as it truly poses less risk but greater return because naturally, as humans, we're more nervous about giving feedback to a well-developed prototype than a sketch board. Yet, this is where the magic happens, because we can combine all the brilliant-minded feedback to make the impossible possible. Design helps leave the world better than we found it and opens the mind to creativity. Creativity is someone going outside what was previously known as the only path and creating another one.

                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>For people with depression, the bed can become a clutch to cope when wanting to avoid overrbearing duties. People nearest to you can try to simplify it by saying "just get up earlier" ignoring the neurological reality: executive dysfunction makes even basic tasks feel insurmountable. When you combine the dread with obnoxious 'alarm clocks' it becomes easy to treat waking up as a willpower issue. It's not. It's a design issue. My objective is to make getting up an enjoyable and simplified process.</p>

                        <h3>User Research</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interview individuals with depression to understand how executive dysfunction affects their morning routines, sensory triggers, and emotional responses to alarms</li>
                            <li>Observe night routine to understand what other contirbuting factors may lead to snoozing the alarm </li>
                            <li>Observe how many times the snooze occurs and what would be potential motivating factors </li>

                        <p>Many students experience food insecurity while edible surplus food exists across campus. Because current systems for sharing extra food are inconsistent and disconnected, students who need support often miss out. Communication is scattered, access is unpredictable, and volunteer coordination is unclear. The result is preventable hunger and unnecessary waste. There is a need for a centralized, student-centered, dignity-focused way to connect available food with those who need it most.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Growing up, I watched loved ones struggle to access treatment outside of clinical and educational settings, 
                carrying invisible burdens they felt they had to navigate alone. As a result, I started questioning. 
                I wanted to know why, and how I could help: design items and environments not solely just for function, 
                rather to make impact. I purposely got involved in research methods, and participated in an incubator trying to plan real intervention. It revealed to me that equity requires intention. 
                Now, I'm learning inquisitive processing and iteration create the best designers. 
                It is not only about tangible items but about questioning the frameworks we inherit.
